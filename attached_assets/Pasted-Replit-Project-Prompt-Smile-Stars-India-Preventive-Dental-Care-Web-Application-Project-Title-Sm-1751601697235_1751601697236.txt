Replit Project Prompt: Smile Stars India - Preventive Dental Care Web Application

Project Title: Smile Stars India - School Dental Care Platform

Technologies: React (Frontend), Node.js (Backend), MongoDB (Database - suggested, but Replit might default to SQLite or offer other options. Specify if you have a strong preference.)

Project Goal: Develop a comprehensive web application to streamline preventive dental care camps for school children, starting with registration, screening, and report generation.

Core Features & Workflow:

School Registration & Camp Scheduling:

Admin/School Administrator: Ability to register new schools.

Admin: Ability to schedule dental camps for registered schools, including:

Camp start and end dates (1 to 7 days).

Number of students expected (for planning purposes).

Any specific events/requirements for the camp.

Status tracking (e.g., "Planned," "Active," "Completed").

Student Registration & Screening (During Camp):

Dentist/School Administrator: Ability to register individual students during the camp.

Capture student demographic details (Name, Age/Sex, Grade/Roll No., School Name).

Link student to the current active camp.

Dentist: Conduct dental screening using a digital form based on the provided "Screening Proforma." The form should include fields for:

Demographic Details: (as above, pre-filled if registered)

Clinical Examination Details:

Teeth Present (e.g., a visual dental chart or text input)

Dental Age

Decayed teeth (count/specific teeth)

Missing teeth (count/specific teeth)

Filled teeth (count/specific teeth)

Teeth with crowns (count/specific teeth)

Deep grooves

Stains (+ / ++ / +++) - Use radio buttons/dropdown

Calculus (+ / ++ / +++) - Use radio buttons/dropdown

Gingival recession

Tongue examination

Primate spacing

Mid line diastema

Delayed eruption

Cross bite (Unilateral / Bilateral / Anterior / Specific Teeth? - Primary/ Permanent) - Use checkboxes/dropdowns

OpenBite (Anterior / Posterior (Unilateral / Bilateral)) - Use checkboxes/dropdowns

Deep bite

Occlusion

Canine Relationship (Primary: Class I / II /III, Permanent: Class I / II /III) - Use radio buttons/dropdowns

Molar Relationship (Primary: Class I / II /III, Permanent: Class I / II /III) - Use radio buttons/dropdowns

Dental Anomalies

Abnormal frenal attachments

Developmental defects

Habits (e.g., thumb sucking, nail biting)

Trauma (Type of Fracture: Ellies Class – I to IX)

Immature/ mature (for trauma)

Additional field for Prescriptive/Preventive Measures: A free-text area for the dentist to note down specific recommendations.

Report Generation & Parent Communication:

Dentist/Admin: Generate a comprehensive dental health report for each student based on their screening data.

Admin: Send the generated report (e.g., as a PDF or a secure web link) to the registered parent's email address.

Parent Portal: Parents can log in to view their child's dental report and any recommendations.

User Roles & Permissions:

Admin:

Full access to all features.

Register/manage schools.

Schedule/manage camps.

View all student data and reports.

Manage user accounts (dentists, school administrators, parents).

Send reports to parents.

Dentist:

Access to active camps they are assigned to.

Register students during a camp.

Conduct and submit dental screenings.

View and edit screening data for students in their assigned camps.

Generate individual student reports.

School Administrator:

Register students for their school's camps.

View student lists and camp schedules for their school.

View general statistics for their school's camps (e.g., number of students screened).

Limited access to student screening details (e.g., summary, but not full clinical data unless explicitly granted by Admin).

Parent:

Secure login to view their child's dental health report.

Access only to their own child's data.

Technical Requirements & Considerations for Replit:

Frontend (React):

Use functional components and React Hooks.

Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS (or a similar utility-first CSS framework).

State management (e.g., React Context API or a lightweight library like Zustand).

Form handling for student registration and screening (consider libraries like Formik/React Hook Form for complex forms).

UI components for tables, forms, buttons, navigation.

User authentication/authorization flow (login/logout, role-based access).

PDF generation on the client-side (e.g., jsPDF or a similar library) or trigger server-side generation.

Backend (Node.js/Express):

RESTful API design for all data interactions.

User authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT for token-based authentication).

Database integration (MongoDB recommended for its flexibility with schema-less data, especially for screening forms).

Email service integration (e.g., Nodemailer) for sending reports.

Logic for managing schools, camps, students, and screening data.

Error handling and validation for API endpoints.

Database (MongoDB - if applicable in Replit):

Collections for users, schools, camps, students, screenings.

Define appropriate schemas for each collection.

Deployment: Replit's built-in deployment features should be leveraged.

Initial Steps for Replit:

Set up a React + Node.js template.

Backend Structure:

Create server.js (or app.js) for your Express server.

Set up basic routes for authentication (login, register).

Implement MongoDB connection (if using).

Frontend Structure:

Create src/App.js as the main component.

Set up basic routing for different pages (Login, Dashboard, School Management, Camp Management, Student Screening, Parent Portal).

Implement a simple navigation bar.

User Authentication: Start with basic login/registration for different roles.

School Management: Implement the UI and API for adding/viewing schools.

Considerations for Replit Environment:

Environment Variables: Use Replit's secrets management for sensitive information like database connection strings, API keys for email services, etc.

Database Setup: If Replit doesn't offer direct MongoDB integration, you might need to use a free tier MongoDB Atlas cluster and connect remotely.

Scalability: For a real-world application, consider more robust solutions, but for a Replit prototype, focus on core functionality.
